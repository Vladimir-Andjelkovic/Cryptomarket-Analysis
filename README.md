# Cryptomarket-Analysis

This poject takes 30 newest crypto currencies, gets their name, url and price with web scraping.
It should run every hour and collect info on said currencies.
At the moment get_coin_urls() should be run only once to get urls, I'll upgrade it in the future to not need manual support.
Data is analyzed and in Reports/DailyReport.txt you can find growth and average growth of each coin.
